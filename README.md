* State
* Region
* Confirmed
* Deaths
* Recovered

## Analysis
During the analysis, the following steps were taken:
* Checked for null values in the dataset and fixed them if any were found.
* Analyzed the number of confirmed cases in each state to identify areas that were most affected by the virus.
* Grouped the data by region and analyzed the distribution of cases by region.
* Analyzed the number of deaths in each state to identify areas that were most affected by the virus.
* Analyzed the number of recoveries in each state to identify areas that had successfully recovered from the virus.

## Conclusion
The COVID-19 dataset provides valuable information about the impact of the virus up to April 29, 2020. The analysis showed that certain states and regions were more affected by the virus than others, and that the number of deaths and recoveries varied across the country. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into the spread of the virus and take appropriate actions to mitigate its impact.
